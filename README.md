# terrible-website-contest-chinatsu

This is one of the worst website.

This is my 3rd and final assignment for the 2nd course in Tamwood. 
 -Course's Official Title: Fundamentals of CSS, CSS Pre-Processors, Frameworks, and Version Control Systems
We have Terrible Website Contest. Each of us will participate individually.

: INSTRUCTIONS : 
-There are three primary categories below.
 1. Eye Sore: My web page is hard to look at, for example terrible color choices and borders, etc. 
 2. Cognitive Overload: My web page has too much information crammed in small places, text, icons, etc. 
 3. Frustrating UI/UX: My website is difficult to navigate, too much scrolling, horizontal scrolling, annoying buttons, etc.
-There is one bonus category below.
 4.Best Easter Egg: Something is hidden in my website and we must look for it, and it is well hidden and exciting to search for it.

My website must participate in at least two categories, so make sure I try to compete in at least two categories, 
one of which should be one of the three primary categories.

Note: Do not use inappropriate or potentially offensive images, text, or content in my websites. Keep it Safe for Work.
